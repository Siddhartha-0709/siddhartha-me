This is the frontend repository for my portfolio website. The website is built using React, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is a component-based framework that allows developers to build reusable UI components. The website utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be used to style the website. 

The backend of the website is built using Node.js and Express.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features and functionalities for building web applications and APIs. The backend connects to MongoDB, a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format.

The website is deployed using Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions that fits perfectly with the Jamstack architecture. The website is hosted on a CDN (Content Delivery Network) and is accessible to users around the world.
