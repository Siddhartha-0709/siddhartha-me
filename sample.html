      <h1 class="text-2xl mt-3 mb-1 font-bold">Operating System</h1>
      <p class="text-xl ">An operating system is a system software that acts as an interface between the user and hardwares of a computer and reduces the internal complexity.</p>
      <p class="text-xl ">The main functionalitites of an operating system are as follows:</p>
      <ul class="text-xl list-decimal list-inside font-bold ml-5">
        <li>Process Management</li>
        <li>Memory Management</li>
        <li>File Management</li>
        <li>Input/Output Management</li>
        <li>Security Management</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 class="text-2xl mt-3 mb-1 font-bold">Program v/s Process</h1>
      <p class="text-xl ">A program is a set of instruction that is given to the computer to execute a specific task.</p>
      <p class="text-xl ">A program under execution is called a process.</p>
      <h1 class="text-2xl mt-3 mb-1 font-bold">Stored Program Architecture</h1>
      <p class="text-xl ">A stored program architecture is a type of computer design where programs are initially stored on a hard disk, which offers substantial storage capacity but slower access speeds. During execution, these programs are transferred to RAM, which, although having less storage capacity, provides much faster access speeds.</p>
      <p class="text-xl ">The schedulers involed in this are the following:</p>
      <ul class="text-xl ml-5">
        <li><strong>1. Long-term schedulers-</strong> They determine which processes, from a larger pool, will be loaded into RAM for execution by the CPU.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Short-term schedulers-</strong>They determine which one process, out of the multiple processes in RAM, will be executed first by the CPU.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="text-2xl mt-3 mb-1 font-bold">The various types of Operating System</h1>
      <ol class="text-xl">
        <li><strong>1. Serial Processing OS- </strong>In this type of OS the jobs are executed in a sequential manner in the order of First Come First Serve. In this the jobs are submited in the form of punch cards to a program counter which executes all instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Batch Processing OS- </strong>In this similar types of jobs are grouped together and executed in a batch manner. There is a concept of resident monitor which manages the automatic sequencing of jobs.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Multi-Programming OS- </strong>In this type of OS we can execute multiple programs on the system at the same time. In this the CPU is never idle and it ensures maximum CPU utlization and maximum throughput.
        <br>
        In this OS if one process other goes I/O operation the other process undergoes execution by the CPU.
        </li>
        <li><strong>4. Time Sharing OS- </strong>In time-sharing OS a process is alloted a certain period of time before which it has to complete its execution and after which it can be executed again. This short period of time is called Quantum Time.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Network OS- </strong> This types of OS connects multiple devices or computers on the network and allows them to share resources.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Distributed OS- </strong>In this the OS is separated into various sections which are loaded into multiple machines rather than a single machine.</li>
        <li><strong>7. Multi-Processor OS- </strong>In this type of OS the computer has multiple processors which can execute multiple programs at the same time.</li>
        <li><strong>8. Real Time OS- </strong>In this OS the process have to be executed before a certain deadline. It is of the following types,</li>
        <ul class="text-xl ml-5 mt-3">
          <li><strong>1. Hard RTOS-</strong> In this if the process completes after a given deadline the entire system crash. They are used in aircrafts and missile systems.</li>
          <li><strong>2. Firm RTOS-</strong> In this if the process completes after a given deadline the output may not be useful but the result may be useful. For Example- Video Conference</li>
          <li><strong>3. Soft RTOS-</strong> In this if the process completes after a given deadline the importance of the output decreses. For Example- Internet browsing.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h1 class="text-2xl mt-3 mb-1 font-bold">Different architectures of Operating Systems</h1>
      <ol class="text-xl">
        <li><strong>1. Layered Structure-</strong>In this the operating system is divided into several modules or layer. The beauty of this syetem is that if one if the modules fails we can repair only that one.
        <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/siddhartha-dev.appspot.com/o/operating%20system%20blog%2Fdiagram-export-13-06-2024-01_25_07.png?alt=media&token=fcf2c371-016f-47c1-b674-47d85b063372" alt="" class=" ml-auto mr-auto mt-3 mb-3 rounded-lg">
        </li>
        <li><strong>2. Kernel OS-</strong>The kernel OS can be further be classified into two categories,
        <ul class="text-xl ml-5 mt-3">
          <li><strong>1. Monolithic Kernel-</strong> In this the operating system manages the system resources between the application and hardware but the user services and kernel services are implemented in the same address space.This approach makes the operating system very fast and due to this the size of the kernel increases but if one component stops working the whole system will crash.
          <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/siddhartha-dev.appspot.com/o/operating%20system%20blog%2Fdiagram-export-13-06-2024-01_37_50.png?alt=media&token=13c8d4b5-5906-452d-a7c8-b9a7b142b9e2" alt="" class=" ml-auto mr-auto mt-3 mb-3 rounded-lg">
          </li>
          <li><strong>2. Micro-Kernel-</strong> In this the user services and kernel services are implemented in different address spaces. The user service is kept in user space and kernel service is kept in kernel space. This approach makes the operating system slow and due to this the size of the kernel is also less. <br>On the other hand if one component stops working the whole system will not crash as the user service and kernel service is isolated. The interaction between the client program and the services running in user address space is is establised through message passing which makes it slow.

        </li>
        <li><strong>3. Virtual Machines:</strong> A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that allows a single physical machine to operate as multiple virtual machines. There are different types of virtual machines, including:
            <ul class="text-xl ml-5 mt-3">
                <li><strong>1. Type-1 VM or Hypervisor:</strong> This type of VM runs directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and manage guest operating systems. Because it does not require a base operating system, it is often called a "bare-metal" hypervisor. Type-1 hypervisors are commonly used in enterprise environments for their efficiency and performance. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.

                </li>
                <li><strong>2. Type-2 VM or Hosted Hypervisor:</strong> This type of VM runs on a conventional operating system as an application. The host operating system manages the hardware, and the hypervisor provides virtualization services. Type-2 hypervisors are typically used in desktop and development environments where convenience and ease of use are prioritized over performance. Examples include VMware Workstation, Oracle VM VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.

      <p class="text-xl mt-3 mb-1">With this comprehensive overview, you now have a solid foundation for your understanding of operating systems. Throughout this discussion, we've delved into what operating systems are, explored the various types of operating systems available, and examined the roles and functionalities of kernels and virtual machines.
        <br>
        To recap, we've learned that an operating system is a crucial software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing essential services for computer programs. We've also distinguished between different types of operating systems, such as batch operating systems, time-sharing systems, distributed systems, and real-time systems, each serving unique purposes and environments.
        Furthermore, we discussed kernels, the core component of an operating system that manages system resources and communication between hardware and software. We also touched upon virtual machines, which allow multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical machine, providing flexibility and efficient resource utilization.
        <br>
        This is just the beginning of your journey into the world of operating systems. There's so much more to explore and understand, from advanced concepts like process management, memory management, and file systems to contemporary topics such as containerization and cloud computing.
